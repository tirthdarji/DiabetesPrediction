## Overview

Performing a prediction for early detection of diabetes on the given dataset with the help of machine learning models and analyzing the patterns.

## Abstract

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a severe public health issue that is on the rise around the globe. It is essential to interfere with the diseaseâ€™s progression through early detection among individuals with a high risk of developing diabetes. Machine Learning is able to identify patterns, behaviors, and trends in any dataset, as well as predict specific outcomes. Several Machine Learning algorithms and models are used to predict the risk of diabetes based on various data as categorical variables such as clinical features. In this paper, machine learning models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Extreme Gradient Boost are used to explore the clinical features of a given dataset published by the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository and train them to predict the risk of diabetes. Furthermore, these models are compared with each other using the classification accuracy of each algorithm.
